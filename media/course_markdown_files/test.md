## Sample Python Code

Below is an example of a Python function that calculates the factorial of a number:


        def factorial(n):
                """
                Calculate the factorial of a number.

                Parameters:
                n (int): The number to calculate the factorial of. fgfds fgsdhfgsdhfgsdhfg

                Returns:
                int: The factorial of the number.
                """
                if n == 0 or n == 1:
                        return 1
                else:
                        return n * factorial(n-1)

        # Example usage
        number = 5
        print(f"The factorial of {number} is {factorial(number)}")
